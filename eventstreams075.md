<!-- 02/07/18 - removing words to help deprecate MQ Light
In most cases, {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} is best used with a Kafka client. The {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API is simple to learn but has very limited scalability and does not offer interoperability with other {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} APIs.
The {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API is available in the following {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} regions only: US South, United Kingdom, and Sydney. The {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API not available in the Germany region or in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated.
