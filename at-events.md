## Where to view the events
{: #ui}

<!-- For example, choose one of the following two options. -->

<!-- Option 2: Add the following sentence if your service sends events to the account domain. -->

{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} events are available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} **account domain** that is available in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} location (region) where the events are generated.

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} service are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch#launch_step2){:new_window}.
