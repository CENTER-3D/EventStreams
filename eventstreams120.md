# Streaming log events from LogDNA to third party tools
{: #streaming_events_from_logdna_to_3rd_party_tools}

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} can be used to stream log events from LogDNA to third party tools, such as Splunk.
{: shortdesc}

You can configure LogDNA to stream log events into an {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} instance. Once in {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, these events can be forwarded to many third party tools using Kafka Connect.

For the step-by-step instructions, see [Streaming log events from LogDNA to Splunk ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://ibm.github.io/cloud-enterprise-examples/log-streaming/configure-streaming-for-third-party-tools/){:new_window}.
